>THE MISSION
To track one million pounds of fat off Humanity through The Superior Eating System which is a six month System.
Best part is the customer gets to talk to the guy they are speaking to.  I do all customer intake calls.  Just kidding at the start yeah but after three sales I'm going back to Executive mode where I am most effective.  

So we post user results.  This is where I see html spreadsheets in vim.

REQUIREMENTS: Send us your weight once a week every Friday morning as soon as you get up.  
Check your email for the System and your off to it.  Contact me anytime.  

So first task is to build a chat bot following the pre-planned conversation on orcanutrition.com.
Second task is for me is to email customers every wednesday evening with an encouraging reminder to weigh first thing in the morning and send the numbers to results@orcanutrition.com
