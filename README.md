Facts: I am 183 pounds which is 83007 grams.  The Dream was one day be able to weight 180.  I missed last weeks weigh in and stuck to The Principles of The Superior Eating System and now I am down 5 pounds which is 
The Mission here 2267grams.  That is over 14 days. So 2267/14=162grams a day is the [GRID]
grams of Matter.  All Matter Matters.  Ninja Likes Matter Too
1 pound = 450 grams so [1,-450]
So simply if one wants to lose one pound a week that is them living in a 450g deficit per day so 450*7days= 3,333 grams for the week.  I feel the best of me comes out when I am living on a calorie defecit.  I live for the fight of survival on our journey to reach a health age of 144 years old with 144,444 of u$

>THE MISSION = 80,000 grams
To track one million pounds of fat off Humanity through The Superior Eating System which is a six month System.
Best part is the customer gets to talk to the guy they are speaking to.  I do all customer intake calls.  Just kidding at the start yeah but after three sales I'm going back to Executive mode where I am most effective.  

So we post user results.  This is where I see html spreadsheets in vim.

Weekly REQUIREMENTS: Send us your weight once a week every Friday morning as soon as you get up.  
Check your email for the System and your off to it.  Contact me anytime.  
Post your results somewhere publically and your thoughts on what worked, what didn't work and what your going to do differently then last week.

1) Build a chat bot following the pre-planned conversation on orcanutrition.com.

2) Orca Nutrition will set up a DRIP Campaign to act as a lodestone which attracts metal.  Attracting metal is revenue goes into Thy bank account on your computer screen.  So Orca Nutrition will email it's customers every wednesday evening with an encouraging reminder to weigh first thing in the morning and send the numbers to results@orcanutrition.com.

Leadership: 25,000 Humans die a day from Starvation and we have the solution.  It's called food.
By exerting more grams then consumed per day one begins to store less fuel that can go feed Richard's kids who sleep on the floor with no blankets in a C-Can in Nigeria.

So this $y$tem works for 15 years now.  I legit won European Muay Thai Champion and Professional Mixed Martial Arts Debut creating this System. I have had 1,111 users adopt Orca Nutrition Culture.  Now the world has more peace, power and joy.
